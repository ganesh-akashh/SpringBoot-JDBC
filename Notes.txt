Spring: (Java Framework) to develop and test applications.

JDBC (Java DataBase Connectivity)

Maven => It is a build tool for java Application.

Dependicies => A dependency is an external Java library or module that your project relies on to implement certain functionalities.


SpringBoot : Framework which takes care of all the configuration and makes it easier to spring applications.




Bean => It is an object managed by IOC (Dependency Injection).
getBean => Belongs to an interface Application Context.
@Component: (Denotes the springboot that it is reponsible for creating an object);
@AutoWired => Automattic dependency injection (Creates objects for the class is managed by Spring Inversion of Control)


Eg:

public static void main(String[] args) {
		ApplicationContext context=SpringApplication.run(Demo1Application.class, args);

		Alien obj =  context.getBean(Alien.class);
		obj.code();

}

package com.example.demo1;


@Component
public class Alien {
    @Autowired
    Laptop lap;

    public void code() {
        lap.compile();
    }
}


@Component
public class Laptop {

    public void compile() {
       System.out.println("Hello World!!");
    }

}



@Scope("prototype")  => It is used to avoid the SingleTon class.


Repository Layer => Used for connecting to databases.
